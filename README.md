## Hey There! ðŸ‘‹

I am Gerard, a Community Strategy Associate at Eskwelabs! Eversince I was little, I wanted to explore realities, solve mysteries, and discover more, but then I thought everything in the world has possibily been inveted or created. What can I possibily do? Fast forward 15+ years, I discovered this space and along with the multitude of the world's problems.

This made me belive that there are still a lot to solve, create, and lean. I am total beginner in the Deep Technology, but I learn fast! 

**Interested in:**
âœŠ Social Impact
ðŸ’» Machine Learning Applications
ðŸ¤– Computer Vision
